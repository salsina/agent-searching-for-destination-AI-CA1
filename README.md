# agent-searching-for-destination-AI-CA1
search algorithms (BFS, IDS, A*, weighted A*)

In this project there is an agent who starts from a coordinate in a map and his goal is to reach the final state in the final coordinates.

but there are some balls in the map that he has to place them in their specific ball holders before reaching the final state.

I have tried to find the solution in 4 search algorithms(BFS, IDS, A*, weighted A*) to search for all possible states and find the final answer 

and compared the time differences between them.

the final answer the code outputs is the shortest path of reaching final state, considering placing balls in their places.
